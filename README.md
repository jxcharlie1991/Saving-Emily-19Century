## System components of note

## Self-motivation

This is my first and maybe only GAME, so I won't give up this time.

## Current Stage

Making a game isn't as simple as I imagined. If I want to make a comprehensive 2D game, I will go through three stages of high completeness.

Thus, I designed three games for myself, learning from online resources:

1. Vertical pixel jumping game -- Current stage <b>GoblinJump</b>
2. Horizontal running and jumping game
3. Horizontal fighting game

For pictures drawing, I won't do additional exercises to practise, I will straight take online course to draw.

That's it.
